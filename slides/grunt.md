## Grunt
----
### What?

- Automation - automate your all your tasks in your build process
	- Minification, minify all of your css and/or JS files
	- Setup automated testing using basically any JS test suite (qUnit, Karma, Jasime, etc.)
	- Lint your files to ensure they pass code quality (JSLint/Hint, etc.)

### Why?
- Consistency
 	- Insure your projects are being built in a consistant manner 
 	- Know exactly what your build structure will be every time
- Laziness
	- No one wants to do this stuff by hand
	- No need to get your source files together and manually run things like minification or Google Closure Compiler
- JavaScript
	- Ease of use, everything is written in JavaScript
	- Well documented
	- Pretty much every automation you can think of has been written as a grunt-contrib file
	- If not? Write your own!
